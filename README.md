# Elections-Analysis-1

## Overview of Election Audit

In this challenge, we are tasked with helping Seth and Tom submit the election audit results to the election commission. We will use a set of data called election_result.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Ballot ID, County, and Candidate (3 candidates). 

Our task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following: 
-	The total number of votes cast A complete list of candidates who received votes, 
- the percentage of votes each candidate and county, 
- The total number of votes by candidate and county
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.
- The largest county turnout.
